#summary JavaScript files of provider

The process of receiving the counter values of providers is made in the language [http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript JavaScript] using [AnyBalanceAPI AnyBalance API].

Provider can have one or several [http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript JavaScript] files, the main thing one of them should contain the main function, for example,

{{{
function main(){
  //We will get account settings
  var prefs = AnyBalance.getPreferences();

  //getting counter values
  //doing something for it
  var strGet = AnyBalance.requestGet(url);
  var strPost = AnyBalance.requestGet(url, {login: prefs.login, pass: prefs.pass});

  //extracting from counter value rows
  //...

  //returning the result
  AnyBalance.setResult({success: true, counter: counter});
}
}}}

All files declared in [Manifest the manifest] under `js` category will be uploaded when the update of AnyBalance account in Android [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html WebView] is made and main() function is called. After it received counter values, the provider must call [AnyBalanceAPI#setResult AnyBalance.setResult()], to pass the received counters to AnyBalance program.

In order to receive counters providers should use [AnyBalanceAPI AnyBalance API]. The usual working scheme of main function:
 * Receiving the settings via [AnyBalanceAPI#getPreferences AnyBalance.getPreferences]
 * receiving the pages with appropriate values with the help of the function [AnyBalanceAPI#requestGet AnyBalance.requestGet] and [AnyBalanceAPI#requestPost AnyBalance.requestPost]
 * Extracting counter values from them, keeping in mind the optimization ([AnyBalanceAPI#isAvailable AnyBalance.isAvailable])
 * Returning the result - [AnyBalanceAPI#setResult AnyBalance.setResult]

Nothing difficult. You can see the examples:

 * [TutorialExchangeCbr Currency rates]
 * [TutorialTrackingRussianPost Postal tracking]
